# Contributing to DOME

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the DOME project. It means so much to us.
These are the guidelines you should follow to contribute to DOME. Please use your best judgement.

## Code of Conduct

This project is released with a Contributor [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/domeengine/dome/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## How can I contribute?

### Reporting a Bug / Suggesting an Enhancement

If you find a bug, or want to suggest a new feature or piece of functionality, simply raise an issue and we will consider it.

### Contributing code changes

The DOME repository is managed using a variation of [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). In order to start working on DOME, fork and clone the repository, and then checkout the `develop` branch. From here, you should create a feature branch for your changes.

### Submitting a Pull Request

Once you finish working on your feature, you should create a pull request, targeting the `develop` branch of the repository.
Your code will be checked for code style, presence of documentation if necessary as well as whether your changes match the project Design Philosophy.
When these things have been checked, your changes will be merged.

## Where can I ask for help?

You can ask for help working on DOME in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Py96zeH), or raise an issue asking for help.

## Design Philosophy

DOME is designed and implemented according to a set of core principles:

Minimalism: DOME is a minimal, but all-in-one toolkit. This means that it should only contain things a majority of projects would benefit from. Almost everything is introduced into the core engine with a specific use-case in mind. It's preferred to implement new features as libraries "on-top" of DOME, rather than including everything in the core. The libraries which are frequently moved from project to project make good candidates for new features.

Usage-First: Any new API is designed "usage-first", and then an implementation is built around that. This allows for a more "comfortable" and developer-friendly API, because it's how we would _want_ to use it. Once the API is designed, we do what we can to build an implementation to fit that design, adjusting when technical reasons require it.

## Coding Conventions and Style Guides

Code won't be merged into DOME if it doesn't match the existing code style. Here are some of the more obvious style decisions in the codebase.

### C Style

C-code should conform to the following:

* Variables are named with camelCase.
* Functions are named with camelCase.
* Structs which represent "objects" are usually declared in all capitals.
* Methods associated with structs are named with the format `NAME_methodName()`
* Braces are required for control-flow blocks: `while`, `for` and `if` must be followed by a `{` and `}` to mark out the statements which are predicated on that control flow. This is to prevent copy-paste errors, as well as poor semi-colon placement.

```c
if (condition) { // This brace is on the same line as the ending parenthesis.
  //...
}
```

* A space must be placed after these keywords, and before parenthesis of their conditions.

```c
while (condition) {
  //...
}
```

### Wren

Wren code should conform to the following:

* Classes are named with TitleCase, each word being capitalised, including the first.
* Variables, methods and properties all require camelCase, even when they are intended to be constants (follows Wren convention e.g. Num.pi).
* Constants and variables which do not belong to a class may have the first letter of their identifier capitalised as appropriate. (This is necessary for Wren's scoping rules to work.)

```js
var TheAnswerConstant = 42

var degreeOfSeparation = 6

class GraphVisitor {
  static newProperty { _property }
  static maxTries { 4 }
  static someMethod(withInput) { ... }
}
```

* Spaces around control-flow constructs, in similarity to C-styles.
* Braces around control-flow blocks.
